"""
This script performs a series of vascular network simulations using JAX and plots the scaling results
as a function of the number of vessels. The script is designed to evaluate the computational performance
of different vascular network models.

The simulation process includes the following steps:
1. Set up the environment and configuration.
2. Load and iterate through a list of predefined vascular models.
3. For each model, configure the simulation, run the simulation loop, and measure the execution time.
4. Store the timing results and the number of vessels for each model.
5. Plot the number of vessels against the execution time and save the plot to a file.

Modules:
    - os: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
    - shutil: Offers high-level file operations such as copying and removing files.
    - time: Contains functions for time-related operations.
    - functools.partial: Allows partial function application.
    - jax: The JAX library for high-performance numerical computing.
    - matplotlib.pyplot: A plotting library for visualizing data.
    - src.model: Custom module containing functions for simulation configuration and execution.

Functions:
    - config_simulation: Configures the simulation parameters based on the model's configuration file.
    - simulation_loop: Runs the main simulation loop.

Global Variables:
    - VERBOSE (bool): Controls whether to print detailed logs and timing information.
    - timeings (list): Stores the execution time for each model simulation.
    - num_vessels (list): Stores the number of vessels for each model.
    - model_names (list): A list of vascular network models to be simulated.
    - filenames (list): A list of configuration file paths for each model.
    - CONFIG_FILENAME (str): The current configuration file path being processed.

Usage:
    To execute the script, simply run it in an environment with the necessary dependencies installed.
    The script will generate and save a plot of the simulation scaling results as an EPS file in the
    'results/scaling_results' directory.
